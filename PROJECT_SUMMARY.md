## Claude Sonnet 4.5 Integration Deep Dive

### Function 1: analyzeJobMarket()
**Location:** `src/services/claudeService.js:12-82`

**Purpose:** Analyze job market data to identify emerging roles, declining roles, and trends

**Input:**
- CSV string with 95 job postings (title, company, description, skills, category, salary, location, type)

**Prompt Strategy:**
```javascript
"You are a job market analyst. Analyze these job postings and identify trends:

${csvData}

Provide analysis in this JSON format (respond with ONLY valid JSON, no markdown):
{
  "emergingRoles": [
    {
      "title": "Role title",
      "growthIndicators": "why this is emerging",
      "numberOfPostings": 0,
      "keySkills": ["skill1", "skill2"],
      "salaryRange": "$XXk-YYk",
      "whyEmerging": "detailed explanation",
      "exampleCompanies": ["company1", "company2"]
    }
  ],
  "traditionalRoles": [
    {
      "title": "Role title",
      "evolutionNote": "how AI is changing this role"
    }
  ],
  "keyInsights": [
    "insight about skill trends",
    "insight about AI transformation",
    "insight about career paths"
  ]
}

Focus on:
1. Roles that combine AI/ML with traditional domains
2. New skill combinations that didn't exist 2 years ago
3. How AI is transforming traditional roles
4. Realistic salary ranges based on the data"
```

**Why Claude 4.5:**
- **Context window:** Processes all 95 postings (~15,000 tokens) in one request
- **Pattern recognition:** Identifies subtle trends (e.g., "AI SDR" = emerging, "Senior SWE" = traditional)
- **JSON output:** Returns structured data consistently
- **Market understanding:** Knows which skills are new vs established from training data

**Output:** JSON object with emergingRoles[], traditionalRoles[], keyInsights[]

**Caching:** Results saved to Supabase `market_intelligence` table, expires after 7 days

---

### Function 2: matchUserToRoles()
**Location:** `src/services/claudeService.js:90-175`

**Purpose:** Match user background to emerging roles and provide personalized insights

**Input:**
- User background text (from input OR resume parsing)
- Market analysis results (from analyzeJobMarket)

**Prompt Strategy:**
```javascript
"User background:
${userBackground}

Emerging roles from market analysis:
${JSON.stringify(marketAnalysis.emergingRoles, null, 2)}

Based on this, provide personalized career matches in JSON format:
{
  "topMatches": [
    {
      "role": "Specific role title from emergingRoles",
      "matchScore": 85-95,
      "whyGoodFit": "Explanation based on user's background",
      "transferableSkills": ["skill1", "skill2"],
      "skillGaps": [
        {
          "skill": "Skill name",
          "difficulty": "Easy|Medium|Hard",
          "timeEstimate": "X weeks/months",
          "whyImportant": "Explanation"
        }
      ],
      "careerPathSteps": [
        {
          "step": 1,
          "title": "Step title",
          "description": "What to do",
          "resources": ["Specific course/book/tool"]
        }
      ],
      "salaryRange": "$XXk-YYk",
      "exampleCompanies": ["Company1", "Company2"]
    }
  ],
  "analysisInsights": [
    "Personal insight about user's strengths",
    "Encouraging observation",
    "Actionable career advice"
  ]
}

Important:
- Return exactly 3 matches
- Match scores 90%+ (only show best fits)
- Be specific with resources (not generic "take a course")
- Time estimates should be realistic"
```

**Why Claude 4.5:**
- **Reasoning:** Maps abstract skills (architecture → systems thinking → AI design)
- **Nuanced matching:** Not just keyword match, understands adjacent skills
- **Personalization:** Tailors tone and advice to experience level
- **Resource knowledge:** Suggests real courses, tools (e.g., "Andrew Ng's AI course")
- **Encouragement:** Motivating insights like "Your 7 years of design experience is perfect for AI product design"

**Output:** JSON object with topMatches[] (3 matches), analysisInsights[] (3-5 insights)

**Storage:** Results saved to Supabase `career_analyses` table for history

---

### Function 3: reformatWithClaude()
**Location:** `src/services/resumeParser.js:100-140`

**Purpose:** Clean up messy PDF/DOCX text into structured career summary

**Input:**
- Raw text from PDF.js or Mammoth (often has tables, bullets, formatting artifacts)

**Prompt Strategy:**
```javascript
"Reformat this resume text into a clean, structured career summary:

${rawText}

Requirements:
- Remove formatting artifacts, tables, addresses
- Focus on: experience, skills, education, interests
- Use natural language paragraphs
- Keep all important details
- Output plain text (no markdown)"
```

**Why Claude 4.5:**
- **Context understanding:** Distinguishes signal (skills, experience) from noise (addresses, references)
- **Intelligent reformatting:** Converts resume jargon → natural language
- **Consistent output:** Always returns well-formatted text

**Example:**
```
Input: "John Doe\n123 Main St\nSr PM @ Google  2020-2024\n• Led cross-functional...\nSkills: SQL Python..."

Output: "Senior Product Manager with 4 years experience at Google leading cross-functional teams.
Skills include SQL, Python, data analysis, and roadmap planning..."
```

## Smart Caching System

### Market Intelligence Caching
**Location:** `src/services/marketIntelligence.js`

**Problem:** Market analysis costs ~8,000 tokens per request. Wasteful if job data hasn't changed.

**Solution:** Cache Claude's analysis results for 7 days

**Flow:**
```javascript
// 1. Check if cache exists and is fresh
const needsRefresh = await shouldRefreshMarketIntelligence(7);

if (needsRefresh) {
  // 2. Fresh Claude analysis
  const marketAnalysis = await analyzeJobMarket(csvData);

  // 3. Save to Supabase with version number
  await saveMarketIntelligence(marketAnalysis, {
    source: 'job_postings.csv',
    count: 95
  });
} else {
  // 4. Use cached results
  const cached = await getActiveMarketIntelligence();
  marketAnalysis = cached.analysis_data;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Cost savings:** ~8,000 tokens saved per analysis (after first)
- **Speed:** Instant results for repeat users
- **Consistency:** All users see same market analysis (within 7-day window)
- **Versioning:** Each new analysis gets incremented version number

**Database Schema:**
```sql
market_intelligence (
  id uuid primary key,
  version integer,
  analysis_data jsonb,  -- Claude's market analysis
  metadata jsonb,        -- { source, count }
  valid_until timestamp,
  created_at timestamp
)
```
