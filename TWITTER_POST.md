### Post Text (Concise Version)

Built **FutureShift** with Claude Sonnet 4.5 in 24 hours! 🚀

An AI career advisor that analyzes real job market data to help professionals discover emerging opportunities BEFORE they go mainstream.

**What I built:**
✨ Smart resume parser (PDF/DOCX/LinkedIn)
📊 Job market intelligence (analyzes 95+ real job postings)
🎯 AI role matching (90%+ accuracy scores)
📈 Skill gap visualizations with learning paths
💾 User accounts + OAuth
📱 Fully responsive (mobile menu, toast notifications)

**How Claude Sonnet 4.5 powers it:**
🧠 Analyzes entire job market dataset in one request (extended context window)
🎨 Maps abstract skills across domains (architecture → UX → AI design)
⚡ Progressive analysis UI showing Claude's reasoning in real-time
📝 Intelligent resume reformatting from messy PDFs
🎯 Personalized learning paths with specific resources

**Built in one day:**
- React + Tailwind (glassmorphic UI)
- Express backend (secure API proxy)
- Supabase (auth + PostgreSQL)
- 95 real job postings dataset
- Smart caching (saves tokens)
- Deployed on Vercel + Render

**Personal story:** I spent 7 years in architecture before discovering UX/UI design existed. FutureShift is the tool I wish I had—helping people see tomorrow's opportunities today.
