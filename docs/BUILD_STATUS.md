## Key Files to Monitor

**Watch these files for updates from Claude Code:**

1. `implementation-plan.md` - Overall progress tracking
2. `PHASE_2_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Will show "✅ COMPLETE" when done
3. `src/services/claudeService.js` - Core API integration
4. `src/services/testClaude.js` - Test results
5. Console output - Claude Code's progress updates

---

## Critical Paths

**If Claude Code completes Phase 2 successfully:**
→ It will automatically start Phase 3 (UI Development)
→ You don't need to do anything

**If Claude Code encounters errors:**
→ It will debug autonomously
→ Check console for any blocker issues
→ May need to add API key to .env.local

**If running out of time:**
→ Claude Code will start cutting non-essential features
→ Focus shifts to: working demo > perfect demo

## Success Checkpoints

**By Hour 9 (5:30pm ET):** Phase 2 complete, Phase 3 started
**By Hour 12 (8:30pm ET):** Phase 3 complete, basic UI working
**By Hour 15 (11:30pm ET):** Phase 4 complete, demo polished
**By Hour 18 (2:30am ET):** Deployed and tested
**By Hour 20 (4:30am ET):** Submission posted
**Deadline: 9:00am ET**

## Communication Protocol

**Claude Code → Files:**
- Updates PHASE_X_INSTRUCTIONS.md when complete
- Updates implementation-plan.md with progress
- Creates new files as needed

**Claude Desktop → Human:**
- Notifies when phases complete
- Flags any issues requiring decisions
- Tracks overall timeline

**Human → Claudes:**
- Provides inputs when explicitly needed
- Makes go/no-go decisions
- Reviews final submission before posting

## Emergency Contacts

**If you need to intervene:**

1. **Check implementation-plan.md** - See current status
2. **Check console** - See Claude Code's current action
3. **Check phase instructions** - See what should be happening
4. **Come back here** - Update me on any issues

**If Claude Code gets stuck:**
- It should self-recover
- If not, check the error in console
- Common issues: API key, network, rate limits
